An old, weathered lighthouse keeper with a white beard, thick-rimmed spectacles perched on his nose, and wearing a faded blue fisherman's sweater, sits at a sturdy wooden table inside the lighthouse, a dusty glass bottle in his gnarled hands. He squints at a crumpled, aged piece of paper inside, the light from the lighthouse lantern casting long shadows across the room. The note inside reads: "Help! Marooned on Skull Island!"

The lighthouse keeper, his face crinkled with amusement, lets out a low chuckle, shaking his head. His eyes sparkle with mischief as he remembers a similar prank he pulled decades ago. The room is filled with nautical equipment, and a half-empty mug of coffee sits beside the bottle.

The old man, still chuckling, reaches for an old-fashioned radio console covered in dials and switches. His weathered hand hovers over the microphone, his expression now a mix of amusement and concern. Behind him, the swirling beam of the lighthouse sweeps across the stormy, dark sea outside. The control room is cluttered with charts and maps, bathed in the warm glow of the radio's vacuum tubes.
