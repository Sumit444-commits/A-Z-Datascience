A weathered, old lighthouse keeper with a thick white beard and tired eyes, his face etched with wrinkles from years of sun and sea, bends over a dusty, glass bottle on a rough-hewn wooden table. The bottle, half-buried in sand, lies next to a crumpled piece of parchment. Soft light streams in from a circular window behind him, illuminating motes of dust dancing in the air.

A vast, calm ocean stretches to the horizon under a pale, cloudless sky. The water is a deep, tranquil blue, reflecting the light with a gentle shimmer. A distant, barely perceptible line separates the sea from the sky. A lone seagull soars effortlessly above the water's surface.

Close-up on the lighthouse keeper's hands, gnarled and calloused from years of labor. His fingers tremble slightly as he stares down at them, his aged skin showing a network of fine lines. The background is softly blurred, focusing attention on the vulnerability and frailty of his hands.

The old man stands silhouetted against the bright window of the lighthouse, his form slightly hunched. His expression is a mixture of understanding and resignation, his eyes gazing inward. The light outlines his figure, casting long, somber shadows across the room, emphasizing the solitude and weight of his realization.
