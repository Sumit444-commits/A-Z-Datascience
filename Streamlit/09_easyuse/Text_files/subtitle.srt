1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,264
The rising sun painted the baked brick walls of Mohenjo Daro

2
00:00:04,312 --> 00:00:08,312
a warm orange. Maya, a young potter's apprentice, hurried through

3
00:00:08,336 --> 00:00:11,592
the grid like streets, her bare feet padding softly on

4
00:00:11,616 --> 00:00:15,384
the well worn stone. The air hummed with the sounds of life.

5
00:00:15,552 --> 00:00:19,544
The rhythmic clang of metal workers, the chattering of merchants

6
00:00:19,592 --> 00:00:23,320
in the bustling marketplace, the distant bleating of goats.

7
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,384
The great bath beckoned, its cool water promising respite

8
00:00:27,432 --> 00:00:30,774
from the desert heat. Today, Maya hoped to impress

9
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:34,438
her master with her newest vessel, a clay jar painted with

10
00:00:34,494 --> 00:00:38,294
intricate fish scales, mirroring the bounty the Indus

11
00:00:38,342 --> 00:00:41,750
river provided for their thriving city. Life was predictable,

12
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:45,366
organized and secure within Mohenjo Daro's well

13
00:00:45,438 --> 00:00:46,070
planned walls.
